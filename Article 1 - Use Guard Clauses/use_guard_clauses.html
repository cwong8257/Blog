            As you can see the second function is much easier to
            read and comprehend for two primary reason: <br />
            <br />
            1. The primary logic is not nested at all <br />
            2. You do not have to look further than the return statement <br />
            <br />
            In this example the logic is very short and simple, but
            if you imagine more sophisticated examples, you would have to
            deal with 1+ nesting and scrolling further down to see if there's
            additional logic.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">
var functionWithDeepNestedConditions = (flag, obj) => {

	if (flag == true) {
		if (obj != null) {
			doWorkWithObject(obj):
		}
	}

	doUnrelatedWork();
}

var functionThatWontWorkWithGuardClauses = (flag, obj) => {

	if (flag == false) {
		return;
	}

	if (object == null) {
		return;
	}

	doWorkWithObject(obj);
	doUnrelatedWork();
}
		</code></pre>
        <p>
            However, there's a caveat with using guard clauses. The two
            functions above are not equivalent. If flag is false,
            Function #1 will perform doUnrelatedWork(), while Function #2
            will simply return out of the statement. Ideally, doUnrelatedWork()
            should not be inside the function and should be in the calling function.
            So to use guard clauses, you would have to decompose large functions into
            smaller ones.
